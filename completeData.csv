Data does not take into account statistical revisions (including on student loans accounting) implemented on September 24, 2019. Latest actual data: 2019 Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the U.K.'s Budget Statement 2020. Expenditure projections are based on the budgeted nominal values adjusted to account for subsequent announcements of measures to respond to the outbreak of coronavirus. Revenue projections are adjusted for differences between IMF staff forecasts of macroeconomic variables (such as GDP growth and inflation) and the forecasts of these variables assumed in the authorities' fiscal projections (which did not incorporate the impact of the outbreak of coronavirus). IMF staff data exclude public sector banks and the effect of transferring assets from the Royal Mail Pension Plan to the public sector in April 2012. Real government consumption and investment are part of the real GDP path, which, according to the IMF staff, may or may not be the same as projected by the U.K. Office for Budget Responsibility. Fiscal year GDP is different from current year GDP. The fiscal accounts are presented in terms of fiscal year.
